  <h1>The Wonders of Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Featuring Git and GitHub</h2>
  <h4>March 4, 2015</h4>

      As I begin my journey at Dev Bootcamp, I am just learning about the concept of version control and cannot contain my enthusiasm! Hopefully, I can bring a sense of childlike wonder and excitement that comes with a set of new eyes to an already well-documented subject.

      How many times have I been working on an essay in a word processor, deleted a huge chunk of it, and then somehow managed to save those changes instead of undoing them? More times than I'd care to admit. Even just remembering gives me shudders. After gaping in horror for a few minutes following one of my delete and save episodes, I would resign myself to re-writing my lost work. C'est la vie. There's nothing else to be done, right?

      Wrong!

    </p>
      Correct answer: version control.
    </p>

      Wouldn't have it been nice to know about version control then? How much easier my life would have been if I could just have reverted to an earlier version of the essay. So version control can be useful many types of projects, including writing.For coding, it also has other benefits. It addresses a similar problem I mentioned above - recovering lost code - in addition to allowing someone to determine if a particular change broke or fixed a piece of code, review the history of code, compare two different versions of code, experiment with a new feature without interfering with working code, etc. I'm sure the list goes on. Long story short, I wish I had known about version control sooner.

      Thankfully, I am now armed with this knowledge as I begin my journey learning to code. Just in time! Recommended by DBC, Git is the current version control software I am using. Here's how Git keeps track of changes I make: every time I commit, or save changes, it basically takes a picture of what all my files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. So I can use those references to look at previous versions of a file. Nifty!

      While Git is great for tracking changes made locally on a computer, GitHub is an online service for storing code that can be accessed from anywhere with an Internet connection. It also allows developers to work together on a project by maintaining one version of work that collaboratorsâ€™ work is then merged with. This allows many people to work on and make changes to code without having ending up with several different versions. So GitHub makes collaborating on projects so much easier!

      There you have it! Version control, Git, and GitHub will be playing a crucial role as I learn to code and I can't wait to play with them more. If only I had known about them sooner...
