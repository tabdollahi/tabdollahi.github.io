        Both Ruby's arrays and hashes are indexed collections. They store collections of objects that are accessible using a key. An arrays uses integers as its key while hashes can use any object, such as strings or integers. Basically, arrays and hashes store a list of stuff that can be referenced through its key value. Think of the key value in arrays like the numbers in a numbered list of question and the stored collection values as the questions themselves. You can think ofthe key value in a hash like the words in a dictionary while the definitions are the stored collection values. Of course, this is just one example each of a possible array and hash and there can be many other use cases. I just think this is a good way to understand how arrays and hashes work.

        Whether to use an array or hash is dependent on the type and purpose of a collection. Arrays are ideal for collections that need to be stored in a certain order. (Hashs' key/value pairs do not stay in any sort of sequential order). For example, if you created a list of your favorite movies, you'll want to use an array to store the collection to keep track of your preferences. The ranking in this case is the important part of the collection so an array is ideal.

        Hashes are ideal for when a more descriptive key is needed to access information, like the dictionary example I mentioned earlier. It's much easier to look up the definition of a word by the word itself rather than an ordered number assigned to it. Could you imagine trying to look up the word tangerine by its place in the dictionary represented by a number? Another example of when it would be better to use a hash is if you're pairing student ID numbers to student names. In this case, the hash key would still be an integer (the student ID number), but the order of students doesn't matter.
