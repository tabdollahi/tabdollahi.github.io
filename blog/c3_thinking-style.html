        My Gregorc thinking style is likely a mix of Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random, since I scored about the same for each learning style. Reading the descriptions of each learning style, elements of both resonate with me. Overall, I think being balanced between the two works well for my learning style but I have already noted a few concerns.

        Some of the challenges I face from more of my Abstract Random side is my dislike for routine procedures and orderliness and working within time limits. While I don't think there's anything wrong with disliking routine, it does sometimes leave me feeling overwhelmed as I'm not the best at being organized or managing my time. I think in order to learn more effectively during DBC, it will be important for me to stay organized and stay on a relatively strict timeline for completing challenges. I plan to use timeboxing to help manage my time and thankfully so far, DBC's curriculum on GitHub has been very useful for keeping myself organized!

        One of the challenges I face from the Abstract Sequential side is my fear of appearing foolish/uninformed, which sometimes prevents me from being comfortable working with others. Unless I feel like I have a very thorough grasp of a concept or skill, I don't typically like to talk through or work through problems with others. I'm realizing now at DBC that as I learn to code, there will likely always be an abundance of things I don't know so I need to start getting comfortable with gaps in my knowledge. I'm already working on this and having talked to several other engineers about how there's still so much for them to learn, I'm getting more comfortable with my own ignorance. I find the easiest way to handle a situation with someone when I don't know something is to just be honest about it and google it!
