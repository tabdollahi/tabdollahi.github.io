      Deciding to go to DBC was a shocking decision for some people in my life. A few members of my family seriously questioned if the program is legitimate and if I'd be guaranteed a job after finishing. They asked about what type of certification I'd be getting, if it's anything like a bachelor's degree. An intensive program like DBC is so different than the standard forms of higher education that my family knows of, it seems like a huge risk. I can understand their concern. After seeing Shereef's Fireside Chat though, I wish I had just shown my family that video to answer their questions!

        Shereef's description of DBC aligned very well with what I've been expecting. I agree with his approach that DBC should be seen as a kitchen to work in, rather than a restaurant to be served in. By its very nature, I think learning to code has to be an interactive, engaged process. It not something that can be learned passively, by paying tuition, showing up, and hoping that someone can magically hand out the knowledge necessary to be successful. Instead, I fully expect that I'll have to throw myself into the challenges, struggle, get frustrated, ask for help, and work my ass off to learn to code. And that's exactly what I'm looking for. At this point, I'm not looking for certifications or guarantees like my family thinks I should; I care most about learning and doing something that interests and engages me. I'm taking a leap of faith that the rest of the pragamatic issues (namely, finding a job after DBC) will fall into place as long as I try hard enough.

        In some ways, I'm still nervous about DBC. I have fears that maybe I'm not good enough but I'm working on managing those concerns. Mostly, I'm incredibly excited to be going through this program. To be honest, I'm more excited about DBC than I was about college. Finishing my bachelor's degree felt a lot like sitting through classes that weren't particularly useful for the sake of getting a piece of paper that didn't leave me feeling qualified to do much of anything. And I felt compelled to do it because it's the status quo. I much prefer that DBC isn't offering an arbitrary certification; it's instead offering me the chance, resources, and support to learn as much as I'm willing and able to. I get to do it for no one's sake but my own so I'm incredibly excited to get in the kitchen and start cooking!
